# How to use

---

Step 1:
Download or clone this repo using the link below:

```
https://github.com/DaemonChoejur/newsapp_hydroneo.git
```

Step 2:
Go to project root and execute the following command in console to get the required dependencies:

```
flutter pub get
```

Step 3:
This project uses flutter_dotenv package which requires you to create an .env file
Create a .env file and place it in your assets folder.
Contents of the .env file are as follows:

```
API_KEY = [YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]
DEV_API_KEY = [YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]
```

I have used 2 API keys in the news_api.dart file found in api folder under lib.
Checking where its running on release more or not since the API key has a hard rate limit

```
kReleaseMode ? dotenv.get('API_KEY') : dotenv.get('DEV_API_KEY2')
```
